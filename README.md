# Issue Bot - No Issues with Issue Bot <br />
Problem Statement:<br />
----------
Github is the most popular version control used in Software development lifecycle management.
Issue tracking and management is the most common feature, which is used by software engineers on github platform.
Software Engineers have to perform daily tasks of tracking and maintaining issues, by subscribing to emails and web notifications related to their work repositories.
The implementation of the issue bots should overcome these mundane tasks for the users in issue management lifecycle.
Users interact with the bot in simple phrases, where the user directs specific task to the bot.
Bot triggers the required commands at the backend. This avoids the user to periodically visit github for the follow up of each notification.
The user should have the independence of letting the bot know on what notification he wants to receive. 

Bot Description:<br />
-----------
The Issue Bot is an easy to use bot that helps users in issue maintenance tasks such as:<br />  
* Create Issues using mattermost. <br />
* View  Issues on mattermost by filtering on attributes - tags, authors,milestones etc. <br />
* Tracking messages in mattermost tagged with an issue ID by adding it as a new comment in git. <br /> 
* Escalate stale issues to other team members.<br />
* Send notifications regarding the developments in the issue.<br />
* User can Subscribe/Unsubscribe to notifications for concerned issues.<br />

Bridging the gap between github and mattermost would make project management more efficient. Having these features in our bot helps enhance coordination within the team as a user can easily perform certain tasks from mattermost without having to use the git page and also it helps the developers avoid keeping track of the issues. 

Our Issue Bot is a response to events bot. Our bot falls into the category of chat- Dev Bot since, it acts as a mediator between the people  by sending notifications.
