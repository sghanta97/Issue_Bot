For this milestone, we are working on implementing our use cases and applying the best software practices. For each use case, we are implementing the basic flow as described in the use case. We are using Pair Programming as our core practice and Shared Code as our corollary practice. We are integrating these practices into our software development.

**Software Processes**: 
Brainstorming on the core practices which we want to integrate in our software development- Pair Programming and Continuous Integration  
Refactoring: Improvement in the design of existing code without changing functionality

**Corollary Practices:**
**Shared Code-**
Anyone on the team can improve any part of the system at any time.

**Work Progress**
We have created a project board on 21st Oct and distributed all the tasks uniformly among the team members as user stories.
