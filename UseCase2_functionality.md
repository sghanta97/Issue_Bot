# Escalate stale issues to other team members
* An issue is considered as a stale issue if it has not been updated for the last 24 hours.
* The Bot notifies the owner of the issue about stale issues by sending a direct message  every 24 hours. 
* The owner of the issue can then reassign the stale issue to some other team members.


Assumptions: 
* Every issue should have a single assignee.  
* Github username and mattermost username should be same.
