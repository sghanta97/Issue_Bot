## BOT development Process  

### Design Milestone  
For this milestone we described the problem statement for our bot along with the architecture design we planned to use for the development process. It was challenging to come up with proper UseCases for our IssueBot, but after some consideration we were able to come up with some UseCases followed by feedback from the professor. During this Milestone we also had the opportunity to build Storyboard and Wireframes.   

### Bot Milestone  
During this milestone we modified our UseCases again based on the Professors Feedback. For this milestone we came up with implementation logic for the bot, but we used mock data and did not actually interact with git. The aim of this endeavour was to get a feel of how the final interactions of the bot with users would shape out to be and also focus on our bot logic. We had also done Selenium testing during this milestone. 

### Process Milestone
For this Milestone we created a project board and distributed all tasks equally between the team members. We also started keeping a short note of our team meetings and integrated our bot with git to get a working implementation. During this milestone we also got the opportunity to try out pair programming and found it to be quite effective since it helped us in improving the quality of the code and eliminate the bugs/defects which might have got neglected had there been only one developer working on that task. The most challenging part during this milestone when we started interacting with actual data as the code would often break when edge cases were not handled.       
### Deploy Milestone
For this milestone we have refined our UseCases further and also focused on Deploying our bot on a remote environment ( Public Cloud - GCP). We have written an ansible script to automate bot deployment on any new environment.  


In contrast to the projects we did in our respective companies, which had hierarchical structure where mostly the team lead decides and others follow, we felt that each member in this project had flexibility of putting their idea upfront and taking the lead to make it work. We had opportunity to rotate roles and experience a developments process in every perspective.aaadd
