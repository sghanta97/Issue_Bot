For this milestone, we are working on implementing our use cases and applying the best software practices. For each use case, we are implementing the basic flow as described in the use case. We are using Pair Programming as our core practice and Shared Code as our corollary practice. We are integrating these practices into our software development.

**Software Processes**:  
**Core Practices**  
After brainstorming on the core practices which we want to integrate in our software development, we selected Pair Programming as our core practise. In this practise, two team members worked on one task at one computer. One member, the driver, had control of the keyboard and mouse and created the implementation. The other member, the navigator, watched the driver’s implementation to identify defects and participated in on-demand brainstorming. The roles of driver and navigator were periodically rotated. On a single usecase, we have commits from multiple team members.

**Corollary Practices:**  
**Shared Code-**  
We followed the practise of Shared Code. Anyone on the team could improve any part of the system at any time. 

**Work Progress**  
We have created a project board on 21st Oct and distributed all the tasks uniformly among the team members as user stories.

Below is the work progress at the end of First Iteration,  1st Nov. We have completed 3 of our tasks and are currently working on 4 other tasks. We are currently on track to complete all tasks before the final deadline.

**Meeting Notes**  

| Date | Meeting Notes
| --- | --- |  
| 21st Oct| We listed all the tasks and assigned them equally among  the team members.|  
| 24th Oct| Brainstorming on the core practices which we want to integrate in our software development. We narrowed down to Pair Programming and Continuous Integration. We selected Pair Programming as our core practise and Shared code as our corollary practise. | 
| 28th Oct| We discussed on the Git API calls.| 
| 1st Nov| We analysed our progress and moved the tasks to their appropriate status on kanban board.| 
| 4th Nov| We analysed tasks assigned to every team member and decided on the user input for each use case.| 
| 6th Nov| We integrated our codes for all use cases and tested the same.|
